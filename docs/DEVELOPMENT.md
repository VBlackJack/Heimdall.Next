# Development Guide

Shared development reference for Heimdall.Next. This file is versioned project
documentation; keep machine-local paths, credentials, editor preferences, and
temporary workflow notes out of it.

## Project Overview

Heimdall.Next is a .NET 10 WPF Windows connection manager for RDP, SSH, SFTP,
VNC, Telnet, FTP, Citrix, and local shell sessions. The app uses MVVM via
CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, SSH.NET 2025.1.0 for SSH/SFTP, WebView2 for embedded
terminals and VNC, and DPAPI + HMAC-SHA256 for local credential protection.

The solution file is `Heimdall.slnx`. Source projects live under `src/` and
test projects live under `tests/`.

## Build, Test, And Run

Common commands:

```powershell
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/Heimdall.App
powershell -File Build.ps1
powershell -File Build.ps1 -Mode Release
powershell -File Build.ps1 -Mode Release -Publish
powershell -File Build.ps1 -Mode Release -DryRun
powershell -File Build.ps1 -Mode Release -Version 2026.033101
powershell -File Build.ps1 -SkipTests
```

Batch shortcuts are also available:

- `Run.bat` — build and launch
- `Test.bat` — run tests
- `Build.bat` — debug build
- `Release.bat` — release pipeline

The current full-suite baseline is:

```powershell
dotnet test Heimdall.slnx --no-build
```

Expected result: 5,453 passing tests and 6 known skipped WPF
`ThemeServiceTests` that require a live `Application` context.

Per-project TRX summaries can hide skipped tests or report smaller totals.
Use the aggregated solution command when checking the real baseline.

## Build Script Gotchas

`Build.ps1 -SkipTests` skips the test pass and also skips building test
assemblies. Running `dotnet test --no-build` immediately afterwards can run
stale binaries or fail to find tests.

When iterating on tests after a skipped build, run:

```powershell
dotnet build Heimdall.slnx -c Debug -p:nodeReuse=false
dotnet test Heimdall.slnx --no-build
```

The build script updates `src/Heimdall.App/Heimdall.App.csproj` version
metadata before building. If you run `Build.ps1` during a development pass and
do not intend to keep the auto-bumped version, restore the project values
before committing.

## Version Conventions

`Heimdall.App.csproj` carries:

- `<Version>1.0.MMDD.xx</Version>`
- `<InformationalVersion>YYYY.MMDDxx</InformationalVersion>`

`Build.ps1` auto-increments `xx` based on existing distribution folders, the
current project version, and recent GitHub release tags when available. The
`-Version` flag overrides auto-increment and expects the `YYYY.MMDDxx` format.

Build outputs are ignored and written under:

- `Dist/debug/`
- `Dist/release/`
- `Dist/installers/`

## Code Standards

- License: Apache 2.0, author "Julien Bombled" on new files.
- Code, comments, and versioned docs use English.
- Nullable reference types are enabled project-wide.
- Warnings are errors via `Directory.Build.props`.
- Prefer async APIs and do not block the UI thread.
- Keep WPF logic in ViewModels; code-behind should remain minimal event
  wiring unless the platform integration requires otherwise.
- User-facing strings belong in `locales/en.json` and `locales/fr.json`.
- Shell arguments must go through `InputValidator.EscapeShellArg()` or a
  structured argument API such as `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList`.
- Prefer existing project patterns and helper APIs over new abstractions.

## Localization And I18n

Locale files currently contain 5,489 leaf keys each, and CI enforces EN/FR key
parity.

Key conventions:

- CamelCase keys by context, for example `ErrorPlinkNotFound` or
  `BtnConnect`.
- New XAML should prefer `{loc:Translate Key}` for live locale updates.
- Legacy imperative `ApplyLocalization()` paths still exist; migration is
  incremental.
- Tool descriptions may use `ToolDescriptor.DescriptionKey`; otherwise the
  default convention is `ToolDesc{Id}`.

## Namespace Conventions

Before creating a new namespace under `Heimdall.Core.*`, check the chosen name
against .NET top-level namespaces such as `System`, `IO`, `Net`, `Threading`,
`Linq`, `Text`, `Collections`, `Diagnostics`, `Security`, `Runtime`, and
`Globalization`.

If the name collides, choose a disambiguated project-specific namespace and
match the folder path to it. Example: use `Heimdall.Core.SystemInfo` with
`src/Heimdall.Core/SystemInfo/`, not `Heimdall.Core.System`.

## Where To Find Things

- `src/Heimdall.Core/` — shared models, config, security, localization,
  state machine, discovery, validation.
- `src/Heimdall.Ssh/` — SSH.NET integration, Pageant, Plink fallback,
  host-key trust, tunnel manager.
- `src/Heimdall.Sftp/` — SFTP/FTP `IRemoteBrowser` implementations and
  remote file editing.
- `src/Heimdall.Rdp/` — RDP ActiveX host and credential autofill helpers.
- `src/Heimdall.Terminal/` — local shell, pipe mode, Telnet, terminal
  abstractions.
- `src/Heimdall.App/` — WPF composition root, services, handlers, view models,
  views, themes, localization.
- `src/TwinShell.*` — command library persistence, core models, and
  integration.
- `tests/` — xUnit test projects matching the source areas.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — high-level architecture and design decisions.
- `docs/SECURITY.md` — threat model, security controls, limitations, and
  security test references.
- `docs/TOOLS.md` — built-in tool catalog, tool registry, external provider,
  SecNumCloud, and Command Library reference.
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — known development/runtime issues and fixes.

## CI Expectations

CI should enforce:

- restore/build/test with warnings as errors;
- full solution test suite;
- JSON locale key parity;
- formatting checks;
- informational vulnerable package scan.

Manual dependency review command:

```powershell
dotnet list Heimdall.slnx package --vulnerable --include-transitive
```

Vulnerability scans can include advisories without an immediate upgrade path;
review results before turning them into release blockers.
