# Smoke Tests

This repo now carries a small UIAutomation smoke harness for high-signal desktop checks that were previously rebuilt ad hoc during refactors.

## Files

- `scripts/smoke/uia-common.ps1`
  Shared helpers for launching Heimdall, backing up `settings.json`, waiting for UIA elements, clicking controls, reading combo/list content, and restoring state.
- `scripts/smoke/settings-smoke.ps1`
  Focused Settings page smoke.
- `scripts/smoke/navigation-a11y-smoke.ps1`
  Focused nav-tab and gateway-button accessibility smoke.
- `scripts/smoke/move-to-group-smoke.ps1`
  Focused session-tree move-to-group parity smoke (context menu, expansion retention, destination validation, no-group reachability coverage split between UIA and human checks).
- `scripts/smoke/sidebar-favorites-smoke.ps1`
  Focused sidebar Favorites smoke (section presence, alphabetical ordering, filter interaction, persistence round-trip; ContextMenu-specific flows partially delegated to human checks because WPF popup exposure is inconsistent under UIA).

## Prerequisites

- Windows desktop session with UIAutomation available.
- A Debug build of Heimdall.Next under `src/Heimdall.App/bin/Debug/...`.
- The app must be launchable without first-run dialogs blocking the main window.

### Heimdall-TestEnv SSH fixture

The external `G:\_Projects\Tests\Heimdall-TestEnv` fixture seeds session profiles separately from
gateway definitions:

1. Start the TestEnv containers from `G:\_Projects\Tests\Heimdall-TestEnv`.
2. Import `heimdall-import\servers.testenv.json` through Heimdall's session importer.
3. Inject the TestEnv gateway into the exact build configuration used by the executable:

```powershell
& 'G:\_Projects\Tests\Heimdall-TestEnv\scripts\Inject-Gateway.ps1' `
  -SettingsPath 'G:\_dev\SnapConnect\Heimdall.Next\src\Heimdall.App\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\config\settings.json'
```

Restart Heimdall after this external settings edit. The imported server profiles reference a stable
`SshGatewayId`, but the gateway object itself is stored in `settings.json` under
`AppSettings.SshGateways`; importing only `servers.testenv.json` leaves the edit-session gateway
dropdown empty and tunneled TestEnv sessions unresolved.

## Run

From the repo root:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\settings-smoke.ps1
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\navigation-a11y-smoke.ps1
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\move-to-group-smoke.ps1
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\sidebar-favorites-smoke.ps1
```

To include a build and test pass first:

```powershell
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\settings-smoke.ps1 -RunBuild -RunTests
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\navigation-a11y-smoke.ps1 -RunBuild -RunTests
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\move-to-group-smoke.ps1 -RunBuild -RunTests
pwsh -File .\scripts\smoke\sidebar-favorites-smoke.ps1 -RunBuild -RunTests
```

Each script prints a JSON report and returns a non-zero exit code on failure.

Run them sequentially. They launch and stop the same desktop app and temporarily mutate the same `settings.json`; the tree/favorites scripts also back up and restore `servers.json` when they need to seed or inspect persisted state.

If you include build and test runs, keep them strictly sequential as well: `kill -> build -> test`. Running build and test in parallel can leave `testhost.exe` locking outputs and trigger `MSB3026`.

## Coverage

`settings-smoke.ps1` covers:

- opening the Settings page
- credential provider preset population
- preset selection updating the command field
- save + restart persistence for the credential provider command
- command-library token status empty-state rendering
- external-tool provider status rendering
- external-tool placeholder legend population
- external-tool preview refresh when selection changes
- EN/FR localized rendering checks after restart

Notes:

- The locale switch is save-gated by current product design, but the scripted smoke uses `settings.json` + restart for stability.
- Credential provider preset labels are intentionally treated as a static catalog. The script records them in EN and FR but does not fail if they stay identical.
- Runtime invocation of external tools from a live session/context menu is still a manual smoke.

`navigation-a11y-smoke.ps1` covers:

- top nav-tab `AutomationProperties.Name` values in EN
- top nav-tab `AutomationProperties.Name` values in FR
- gateway action button `AutomationProperties.Name` values in EN
- gateway action button `AutomationProperties.Name` values in FR

`move-to-group-smoke.ps1` covers:

- session-tree context-menu move to another group
- in-memory expansion retention across the unified move path
- destination-set parity against project-scoped group targets
- no-group entry presence in the move submenu
- persistence-backed verification that the move reached the expected target group

Notes:

- The script uses the shared `uia-common.ps1` helpers plus local tree/menu helpers.
- Some drag/drop-adjacent checks remain manual by design: drag cursor feedback, Escape cancel, scroll perception, and the no-group drop-zone affordance.
- The report uses per-scenario statuses (`Green`, `Red`, `Skipped`) because some WPF popup interactions are intentionally delegated to human smoke.

`sidebar-favorites-smoke.ps1` covers:

- Favorites section presence in the sidebar Tools tree
- alphabetical ordering of favorited tools by localized display name
- sidebar filter interaction against the Favorites section
- persistence round-trip for `FavoriteToolIds` across restart

Notes:

- The script pre-seeds `FavoriteToolIds` in `settings.json` for deterministic ordering/filter checks.
- WPF programmatic ContextMenus are not reliably exposed in the UIA tree, so pin/unpin and right-click-no-launch verification remain human smoke scenarios.
- The report follows the same `Green` / `Red` / `Skipped` scenario model as `move-to-group-smoke.ps1`.

## Manual Checks Still Worth Keeping

These are still better as manual smokes:

- session-tab drag reorder / merge / detach
- drag cancel by `Escape`
- visual drop-target highlight confirmation
- SSH failure disclosure (`Stage` / `Code` / `Detail`) on auth, gateway, and network errors
- RDP pre-tab failure disclosure (tunnel / credential / `.rdp` write / launch) when an easy repro is available
- RDP RD Gateway profile: entering `RdpGateway` forces External mode, imported `.rdp` gateway profiles launch externally, and the lightweight mstsc tab shows launch/autofill/closed status without exposing the password
- RDP Settings presets: add/remove/reset width-height rows, invalid rows stay visible, Save is blocked until fixed
- RDP mid-session pane-scoped disclosure and clear-on-reconnect behavior when a test server is available
- RDP Fit Window mode (default): connect to any RDP target and verify no horizontal or vertical scrollbars appear on the embedded session at any window size or after a resolution change
- RDP fullscreen exit via the chip, F11, Esc, and Ctrl+Shift+F11, with focus both on WPF chrome and inside the RDP session
- RDP fullscreen foreground filter: while Heimdall is fullscreen but another app is foreground, Esc / F11 must reach that foreground app and not be absorbed by Heimdall
- RDP letterbox bars in fixed-resolution mode render with the themed background color, not the default light-grey host surface
- ServerDialog Resolution profile section: four-mode conditional visibility, EN/FR localization, validation badges, snap-to-4, and save-as-default round-trip via the tab context menu
- split-pane correctness for per-pane diagnostics (disconnect only one pane, verify the sibling stays clean)
- session-tree drag cursor / no-group drop-zone affordance
- sidebar tool ContextMenu pin/unpin flows and right-click no-launch behavior
- command palette close on cross-process foreground change
- Narrator or NVDA pass on newly added controls

## Extending The Harness

- Dot-source `scripts/smoke/uia-common.ps1` instead of reimplementing launch/wait/click logic.
- Prefer stable `x:Name` or `AutomationProperties.AutomationId` on controls that matter for smoke coverage.
- Back up and restore `config/settings.json`, and `config/servers.json` as well when a smoke seeds or mutates the session tree.
- Keep reports structured: a top-level `Result`, then per-scenario `Green` / `Red` / `Skipped` statuses with sampled strings or reasons explaining what was observed.
- Keep durable repo-versioned smokes separate from one-off diagnostic probes.
